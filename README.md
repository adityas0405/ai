# ai
Created an early prototpye AI that uses Open AI to generate responses, to your queries. 
I plan to add and implement many more features like
- YOLOR for object, face detection.
- More social media integration (instagram, facebook)
- Integrate smart home devices.

I have included all the modules i had installed on requirements.txt. To install them simply open cmd in the folder and run pip install -r requirements.txt.
You would also need to run the whatsapp.ppy and scan the code to set it up. 

You may need to change the api key in Data>Api.txt. You can get the api key from https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys.
